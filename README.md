# Face Mask Detection
COVID-19: Face Mask Detector, developed a detection Model with 99% accuracy in training & testing. Automatically detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not in real-time video streams. we will learn building a Face Mask Detector using Keras, Tensorflow, MobileNet and OpenCV. We will also see how to apply this on a Live Video Camera. With further improvements these types of models could be integrated with CCTV cameras to detect and identify people without masks.


## Our COVID-19 face mask detection dataset

The dataset weâ€™ll be using here today was created and taken from Prajna Bhandary.
This  dataset consists of 1,376 images belonging to two classes: 
with_mask: 690 images
without_mask: 686 images
