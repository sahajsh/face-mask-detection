# Face-mask-detection
COVID-19: Face Mask Detector, developed a detection Model with 99% accuracy in training & testing. Automatically detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not in real-time video streams.
we will learn building a Face Mask Detector using Keras, Tensorflow, MobileNet and OpenCV.  We will also see how to apply this on a Live Video Camera. With further improvements these types of models could be integrated with CCTV cameras to detect and identify people without masks.
The face mask detector didn't use any morphed masked images dataset. The model is accurate, and since the MobileNetV2 architecture is used, it’s also computationally efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems.
This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.

# Our COVID-19 face mask detection dataset

The dataset we’ll be using here today was created and taken from Prajna Bhandary repository- https://github.com/prajnasb/observations/tree/master/experiements/data
This dataset consists of 1,376 images belonging to two classes: 
with_mask: 690 images
without_mask: 686 images
